# Misframed
Sometimes you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.

## Solution
The zip contains 4 gifs. We have to choose the correct frame for each image to get the flag. The 1st and 4th frames are simple, because the flag begins with `flag{` and ends with `}`. The 2nd and 3rd frames can be found by looking to create words.
### Flag
`flag{th3y-t4k3_7he+J~tr4in}`
